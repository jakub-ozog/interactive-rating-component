## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge that I have created for excercise purposes

Project has been created based on the materials that I have downloaded from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) to improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Deploying your project

Project has been hosted on Vercel in order to get a live preview of the code etc.
